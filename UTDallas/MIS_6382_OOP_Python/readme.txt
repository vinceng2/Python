Welcome to all the Python coding assignments, including the final project, that I completed in my OOP Python course at UT Dallas. 

HW1: Rudimentary arithmetic, membership operators, and user inputs
HW2: If-else statements, for-loops, and functions 
HW3: If-else statements, for-loops, string methods, and list comprehensions
HW4: Precursor to the final project; functions and classes/objects
HW5: Introduction to Matplotlib and plotting basic bar, line, and pie charts from small datasets 
Final Project: A comprehensive final project covering all the materials from HW1 to HW4

Each assignment, including the final project, contains the instructions, example outputs, and my code.
